A few suggestions for even better quality:

    Error handling:
    You log errors, which is great. Consider sending error events back to the client optionally, so the UI can respond to failures gracefully.

    Use constants for statuses:
    Instead of hardcoding 'DELIVERED' and 'READ' strings, you can define constants or enums to avoid typos.

    Edge case: message-read when sender is offline
    Currently, you notify sender sockets only if they're online. You might want to also update some notification queue in DB or other mechanism for when the sender comes back online.

    Rate limiting or throttling (optional):
    To prevent abuse (e.g., flooding send-message or message-read), consider adding some limits.

    Security:
    Make sure only authorized users can send messages or mark messages as read/delivered for conversations they belong to (e.g., verify userId matches socket authenticated user).
